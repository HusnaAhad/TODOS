/todos/:
  GET:
    success:

      code - 200
      return collection as array
      items show only id and title

  POST:
    success:

      code - 201
      return item as hash with id, title, due, created_at, updated_at

    failure:

      wrong parameters:
        code - 405
        body = 'You must provide the following parameters: <title> and <due>. You provided: ' <<<<< should probably specify but isn't

      too many parameters:
        still works - should it?

      specify id:
        still works - should it?
        id isn't specified

  PATCH:
    failure:
      code - 405
      message "Method not allowed. You cannot update the Collection."

  PUT:
    failure:
      code - 405
      message "Method not allowed. You cannot update the Collection."

  DELETE:
    failure:
      code - 405
      message "Method not allowed. You cannot delete the Collection."

/todos/id
  GET:
    success:
      code - 200
      return todo as hash with id, title, due, created_at, updated_at

    failure:
      wrong id:
        code - 404
        no message - should it have?


  POST:
    failure:
      code - 405
      message "Method not allowed. To create a new todo, POST to the collection, not an item within it."

    failure:
      invalid date:
        code - 500
        returns '<h1>Internal Server Error</h1>'
          SHOULD IT?!

          it should not

          do code 400
          with message 'date in wrong format' eg

  PATCH:
    success:
      code - 200
      return item as hash with id, title, due, created_at, updated_at
      updated_at should be updated

    failure:
      wrong id:
        code - 422 - should it be 405?
        message "You must provide the following parameters: <title> or <due> in addition to specifying the todo's <id> in the URL."

          shuold be 404
          ody should be nil

      wrong parameters:
        code - 422 - should it be 405?
        message "You must provide the following parameters: <title> or <due> in addition to specifying the todo's <id> in the URL."

          should be 422

        Why are these the same?

    QUESTION -- should invalid date return error?

  PUT:
      success:
        code - 200
        return item as hash with id, title, due, created_at, updated_at
        updated_at should be updated

      failure:
        wrong id:
          code - 404
          doesn't give message - yes


        wrong params:
          code - 422
          message "You must provide the following parameters: <title> or <due> in addition to specifying the todo's <id> in the URL."

      failure:
        invalid date:
          code - 500
          message "<h1>Internal Server Error</h1>"
          DO we think it should?

  DELETE:
    success:
      code - 204
      return nothing

    failure:
      wrong id:
      code - 404
      no message

if ID is too big, returns code 500
  - needs more testingâ‚¬
